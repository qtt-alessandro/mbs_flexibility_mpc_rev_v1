class Bilinear(BaseBasisFunction):
    r"""Build Bilinear basis function.

    A general bilinear input-output model takes the form

    $$
        y(k) = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n_y} a_i y(k-i) + \sum_{i=1}^{n_u} b_i u(k-i) +
        \sum_{i=1}^{n_y} \sum_{j=1}^{n_u} c_{ij} y(k-i) u(k-j)
    $$

    This is a special case of the Polynomial NARMAX model.

    Bilinear system theory has been widely studied and it plays an important role in the
    context of continuous-time systems.  This is because, roughly speaking, the set of
    bilinear systems is dense in the space of continuous-time systems and any continuous
    causal functional can be arbitrarily well approximated by bilinear systems within
    any bounded time interval (see for example Fliess and Normand-Cyrot 1982). Moreover,
    many real continuous-time processes are naturally in bilinear form. A few examples
    are distillation columns (Espa√±a and Landau 1978), nuclear and thermal control
    processes (Mohler 1973).

    Sampling the continuous-time bilinear system, however, produces a NARMAX model
    which is more complex than a discrete-time bilinear model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    degree : int (max_degree), default=2
        The maximum degree of the polynomial features.

    Notes
    -----
    Be aware that the number of features in the output array scales
    significantly as the number of inputs, the max lag of the input and output, and
    degree increases. High degrees can cause overfitting.
